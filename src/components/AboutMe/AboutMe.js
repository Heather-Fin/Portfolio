      I’m Heather, a Computer Science graduate student studying at The University of Texas at Dallas. My focus is in interactive computing and I am interested in Front End Development. Since my undergraduate degree was in Radio Television Film with a focus on VFX/Animation, Front End Development allows me to merge both my logical side with my creative skills.
      <br /><br />
      I am a highly organized and team oriented individual who has a passion for creating content that will improve people’s lives. In my free time, I love learning about various topics including Virtual Reality, Web Programming, and App Development. I am an enthusiast of podcasts, video games, running, and my dog!
